[Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) is a free, [open-source](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/home) client for testing React Native apps on Android and iOS devices without building anything locally. It allows you to open up apps served through Expo CLI and run your projects faster when developing them.

## Install Expo Go on your device

It is available on both the Android Play Store and iOS App Store.

- [Android Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) - Android Lollipop (5) and greater
- [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779) - iOS 13 and greater

## How it works

Expo Go is a native app that is installed on your device. When you run `npx expo start` in your project, [Expo CLI](/more/expo-cli/) starts a [development server](/more/expo-cli/#develop) and generates a QR code. On Android, you can open the Expo Go app on your device and scan the QR code to connect to the dev server. On iOS, use the device's camera to scan the QR code.

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo start']} />

/>

The dev server returns a JSON manifest file that describes the project. Expo Go uses this manifest to download the JavaScript bundle and any assets required to run the project. Then, the [JavaScript engine](/more/glossary-of-terms#javascript-engine) executes this JavaScript bundle to render the React Native app.

You can open and share projects with the members of your [organization](/accounts/account-types/#organizations) by publishing with [EAS Update](/eas-update/introduction). Updates are bundled for production environments using the [`npx expo export`](/more/expo-cli/#exporting) command.

### Manifest

The manifest is similar to an **index.html** on the web. It is served from the root URL `/` and allows downloading the project script code from `bundleUrl`. The manifest can be customized using the app config (**app.json**, **app.config.js**). Additional fields like `icon` and `splash` can be used to customize how Expo Go or `expo-dev-client` presents the app.

```json
{
  "name": "My New Project",
  "entryPoint": "index.js",
  "bundleUrl": "http://localhost:8081/index.bundle?platform=ios"
}
```

### SDK Versions

Expo Go uses **SDK versions** that map to a major release of the `expo` and the Expo Go app. You can see the supported SDK versions in the Expo Go app by navigating to the settings page.

When running a project that was created for an unsupported SDK version in Expo Go, you'll see the following error:
```
"Project is incompatible with this version of Expo Go"
```
To fix this, upgrading your project to a [supported SDK version](/versions/latest/#each-expo-sdk-version-depends-on-a-react-native-version) is highly recommended. If you want to learn how to do it, see [Upgrade the project to a new SDK Version](#upgrade-the-project-to-a-new-sdk-version).

We release a new SDK version approximately every quarter. Find out which [versions of React Native map to which versions of the Expo SDK](/versions/latest/#each-expo-sdk-version-depends-on-a-react-native-version).

#### Upgrade the project to a new SDK Version

> **Info** We recommend upgrading SDK versions incrementally (one at a time). Doing so will help you pinpoint what breaks and other related issues that may occur during the upgrade process.

To upgrade your project, you have to follow these steps:
<Step label="1">
  If you are using EAS CLI, upgrade it to the latest version:
  <Terminal cmd={['$ npm i -g eas-cli']} />
</Step>
<Step label="2">
  Install the latest version of the Expo package. For example, `yarn add expo@^49.0.0`:
  <Tabs>
    <Tab label="npm">
      <Terminal cmd={['$ npm install expo@^<sdk_version>']} />
    </Tab>
    <Tab label="yarn">
      <Terminal cmd={['$ yarn add expo@^<sdk_version>']} />
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
</Step>
<Step label="3">
  Upgrade all dependencies to match the new SDK:
  <Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install --fix']} />
</Step>
<Step label="4">
  Check for any possible issues in your project dependencies:
  <Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo-doctor@latest']} />
</Step>

If you encounter any issues while upgrading, see [blog post](/workflow/upgrading-expo-sdk-walkthrough/) about the SDK version. Release blog posts contain more details about the update process for each SDK version. Also, blog posts include information on any breaking changes introduced in a particular release.

#### Run an unsupported project in an older version of Expo Go

If you can't upgrade your project to a newer SDK version, you can still run it using an older version of Expo Go:
<Step label="1">
  If installed, remove Expo Go from your device/simulator.
</Step>
<Step label="2">
  Start the development server:
  <Terminal cmd={['npx expo start']}/>
</Step>
<Step label="3">
  Press <kbd>a</kbd> or <kbd>i</kbd> to run your app on Android or iOS. This will download and install the compatible Expo Go on your device/simulator and open your project in the client.
</Step>

Compatible Expo Go will be automatically installed on your device/simulator, and your project will open.

> **Note:** This method will not work for physical iOS devices. If you are trying to use this method on a physical Android device, plug it in with a USB cable and have the **USB Debugging** option turned on. To learn more about the Android Emulator and iOS Simulator, see [Login into Expo Go section](#login-into-expo-go).
If you need to run your project on a physical iOS device, consider creating a [development build](/develop/development-builds/introduction/).

## Login into Expo Go

Open the Expo Go app after it has finished installing. If you have [created an account with Expo CLI](/more/expo-cli/#authentication), you can sign in by clicking the **Login** button in the top header on the **Home** tab. Signing in will make it easier for you to open projects in the Expo Go app while developing them &mdash; they will appear automatically under the **Projects** section on the **Home** tab of the app.

> Sometimes, it can be useful to run your app directly on your computer instead of on a separate physical device. If you would like to set this up, you can learn more about [installing an Android Emulator](/workflow/android-studio-emulator) and [installing the iOS Simulator (macOS only)](/workflow/ios-simulator).

## Production

Expo Go is not intended for public distribution. It is a development client that is not optimized for performance. We offer a suite of tools for building and submitting your apps directly to the app stores. For more information, see [Distribution](/distribution/introduction).

You can create your own Expo Go type app by using the [`expo-dev-client`](/develop/development-builds/introduction/) package. This package allows you to create a native client with any custom native code or configuration or a third-party library that requires configuring native code. For more information, see [development builds](/develop/development-builds/introduction/).

You can view the source code for the [Android](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/android), [iOS](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/ios), and [JavaScript](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/home) on GitHub.
